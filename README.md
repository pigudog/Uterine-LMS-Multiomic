This repository contains the code and resources for our comprehensive molecular analysis of uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS). Our study focuses on delineating the malignant programs of LMS using multi-modal data and comparative analysis with normal myometrium and uterine leiomyoma.

ðŸ”¬ Key Features:

- Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of myometrium, leiomyoma, and LMS to define cell states and tumor-specific subpopulations.

- Gene program discovery using NMF to identify malignancy-associated transcriptional modules.

- Spatial transcriptomics (M20-spatial) to localize malignant programs in the tumor microenvironment.

- Bulk RNA-seq validation to confirm the activation of LMS-enriched gene programs in a larger cohort.

- Multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) to verify spatial expression of key markers at the protein level.

This work provides a spatially resolved, transcriptionally defined atlas of uterine LMS, highlighting molecular features associated with malignancy, prognosis, and potential therapeutic targets.
